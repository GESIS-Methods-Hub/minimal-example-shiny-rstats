This example demonstrates the minimal set of metadata supported by [`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) for a [Shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/). It is required to have

```
shiny: true
```

in the YAML header.

The link to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) will launch the Shiny app.

We recommend to include a couple of screenshots of the Shiny app.

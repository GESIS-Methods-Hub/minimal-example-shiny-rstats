This example illustrates the **required** metadata by [`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) for the landing page of a [Shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/). The landing page for a tutorial written as a Quarto Document, an extension to Markdown [@markdown2004].

It is required to have

```
shiny: true
```

in the YAML header for `andrew` to use the correct template.

We recommend to include a couple of screenshots of the Shiny app.

The link to Binder will launch the Shiny app.

Math can be written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and is render by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Both inline, for example $x$, and standalone, for example $$x = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\text{,}$$ is supported.

# Minimal Example of Shiny app with R

[`app.R`](app.R) has the code for the Shiny app with R and [`methodshub.yaml`](methodshub.yaml) shows all the required metadata used by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

This repository uses [install.R](install.R) as [configuration file](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/config_files.html).
